Well i know this much is true, there’s unspoken truth amoung us men, we secretly love hairy vaj. No? Just me?
Oh that leg. Like, she NEEDS to get that looked at!! ASAP!
That has to be an understatement, I know several myself
Not ok. They could have easily given them a drug test if they really wanted to know if they were on drugs. Disgusting.
I'm glad you're feeling better! Keep smiling :)
Thanks the mental heath team at the hospital were good, I can always check in there, if it’s too much
Before he was riding a Bronco he was riding your mom.
Thank you 👏👏 looking like she's going to the gym, yet wearing heels? Looks awful
He's eating cheese and watching football in the sky now. Rest in peace!
[NAME] was the [NAME] of the [NAME] years. Didn't realise he was still about.
I don't believe no one in your class thought of Mac or iPhone.
Sometimes that would work. Sometimes it wouldn't. Regardless, the OP asked what he could do, not who was at fault.
Do hope you're going to let that poor, traumatised boyfriend know. Sounds like he's had more than enough abuse already
>Yes. I’m an idiot. Checks out.
If you'd like to suggest an alternative non-inflammatory metaphor for something that implies racism, I'm happy to consider it.
What a buttnoodle. Glad that “their” cat has a new family and that takes care of them. Thanks for sharing!
I was convinced that you can just use one of the above. If you clean up just like the truck in the back of one person beat him.
Ah it's the old one. First I can remember! Of course not the first. Or the last. Hard to keep track at times...
That's the laziest bro I've ever seen
Because he thought he could do it, but he couldn't make himself pull the trigger.
Right. I'm gonna need to see some hog now, buddy.
The attempt was successful. He's crying and not talking to them because they're actually dead.
I can read the anger in this post.
Wow so much younger but he sounds mature
Yo, this was me last week. Good luck.
the fucking buffet part killed me, i always considered myself good at roasting but damn bro lmaoo
[NAME] doesn’t roll his ankle on a 🎾 in 2011 and we win a premiership imo
Depending on where you live he can be temporarily placed with you or more stable family members until CPS determines that his living situation is either safe or unsafe.
He "dies" shortly after the inn, from a wound caused by the fight he had there. [NAME] just walks away from him.
I'm still testing the waters. Hazelnut mocha latte with almond milk is da bomb!
Do you have the voting link? I went on the NHL website but I didn't see anything.
38k. Between 2 cars. Bought a new X5 and lowered his overall payment. Was tickled to death
It's the same couple of people. The only thing I really dislike about this subreddit is that it swings to the left too hard sometimes.
this is why I love reddit
That's how I apologize to carists, too
Lol! Believe me I get it! Hell, even 11:00 might be pushing it ;-)
Now you’re repeating yourself. Boy bye #wasteoftime. Have fun trying to call this company and their products bunk when everyone loves them haha
Minor character but I love [NAME].
They both crazy
I don't know, but there's probably a word for it in German.
If he's still blaming [NAME] for his issues, the therapist is doing a bad job.
I am just saying in general, in any situation. Work or not.
[NAME], I forgot about that. Eight seconds was more than long enough to murder everybody in sight.
I don't think that's true. Every major story I remember from the [NAME] investigation has been from court documents.
Because he only won it begrudgingly last year. No one likes watching him play. [NAME] will win it unless [NAME] scores 40+ points like every game.
I can't find year stats. Anyhow, I needed the Excel files or a list of numbers in a table.
How random. I did that just riding around town for no reason and saw that lighting.
Mental illness. Operation on 7 people in a manic state . Four of them died. All his money was gone and his rich friends abandoned him.
You haven’t missed anything. I looked out of curiosity and didn’t look twice. I was surprised that Colt would do that.
It's very rare that I have literally no idea who a player is, but here's one.
When you go get your things, if you can bring a friend. Wishing you all the best.
Actually, I don't look a lot in the mirror so I can forget how ugly I am .
Thanks. I desperately need to connect with other women.
[NAME] smashed some kitkats on their table for internet points. Very cool.
I was wondering what that was and now, I need to go get some brain bleach.
Funny because I only owe 20k... I guess no one told these kids community college exists.
People still expecting that are delusional regardless tbh. Messed up they'll never say what happened to Half Life but time to start using some context clues herr
Then she tries to just blow it out. Yup, that should work.
Not suggesting that you wait, but she may later come back after she's gotten that part in her life out.
She has a disorder of sorts. Not only do you both need counseling, but she needs some kind of therapy.
Just horrible. Doesnt solve any of his problem and removes his strongest tool.
I just checked and do see a lot of posts that are not humble brags.
not at all. Hong kong streets and roads are super narrow. I get claustrophobic there.
This. Nurses already have one of the hardest jobs on the planet. They shouldn't have to waste time on this.
She has started therapy with an addiction specialist. That is a hopeful sign IMO. Wish she had started a while ago.
>I clearly have no fuck I clue what I'm doing hire someone
I might not agree with the maduro regime, but t how can BoE justify what amounts to stealing $1.2 billion in gold from Venuzuela?
> Wolf Hall Sounds interesting ! You've inadvertently led me down a rabbit hole of historical wikipedia pages now...
the sky would officially be falling if they changed the pistons name
I would pay good money to watch [NAME] vs Dr. Now!!!
Can you please update me! I'm in the exact position! 24FHL with 21MLL
Yes! I binged it (I was a late adopter) and then all of a sudden nothing!
Right? Remember when she requested evidence of pill testing being successful? Then the stats came in from Canberra. #calledyourbluff
It says "Just because someone *is here* illegally…" No comment at all about how they got here.
I like your enthusiasm and yes it would be hilarious.
exactly how i feel about it too. the guy is just a jerk, and can't be bothered to care unless it benefits him. selfish little prick
He’s one of America’s greatest songwriters.
Find a better partner. It's past time to move on! He sounds very lazy, selfish, and he doesn't care about your needs.
I don't know you or your story, but I fucking love your syntax, word choice, etc 10/10 would trip with
It's fucking incredible how many people would like you if you would just make eye contact and smile at them. Fucking incredible
Unfortunately, I don't. Sorry. 😔
Not everyone agrees that he was actually an amazing strategist or a great general, actually.
Thank you; I tried.
If we shoot by accident we don't keep feeding him when we see he is using siphon that give terimuns a barely a single clamity shot
Lucky it wasnt a prosthetic leg, those abnormal body parts are how they get you
Because they're all done by the same, really, really old guy
Pretty sure he's by far and away the biggest asshat on this sub lmao
I'll try. Thank you.
Feed her poetry. But in a metaphorical way not in a weird way
They're cowards.
It's good to know that I'm not the only one lol
HE SHOOTS AND SCORES!!!!
If he doesn’t respond, then you’re too good for him
He looks like [NAME] long lost cousin
We thought he was getting better but then he turned himself around.
did a fanspeak mock, wow I wish this would go down for us
I always wondered how testicles sound when popping.... hoping that it would never happen to me.
Fix their pay algorithm, the app, rating system, and hire more Dasher support representatives.
We are up 2-0 and this game is pissing me off so much.
H-how did I not notice that?! I was looking at some of those shoes yesterday
She’s a genius! And a goddess. And a queen.
Hopefully he will
People talk so much shit when I say [NAME] is just a fast as [NAME] again, [NAME] just barely wins
WHY THE FUCK IS WES ON THE FLOOR, HE CANT DEFEND SHIT
Yes, I will GI A+B6 LH more often, it's really good. Thank you for the tip!
Not a nice thing to call your lady friend.
Good luck verifying them. All of them.
I actually really like this, and unironically find it funny. Forgive me.
Lol they were trying so hard to get that viral
I love these blobs, would have done the same thing
What are they doing up there?
Ugh I live in WA state and now I'm scared I'm going to get measles even though I'm vaccinated, I hate anti-vaxxers
They have other sources as well, just think about yearly Umra and Haj income will be enough to maintain.
Same with [NAME]. I was even disappointed Parks and Rec had newt gingrich on for a cameo.
A classic question. He wanted to create to share His love and existence.
I wish I could upvote this a million times. What a wonderful tack to take.
Right, but we want to shit talk them directly. Not agree with other people shit talking them.
They confirmed its in the queue, just not yet. Fishing is happening eventually.
True, but it is deceptive when dealing with c diff, it may give them a false sense of security.
Wait you confuse me , [NAME] orb can be deflected , unsure on the healing one tho [NAME] dash CD is 7 second not 11
Easy, stop men from fucking them. Cant be a slut if no one fucking ya right?
You. I like you.
You get closure by blocking her on your phone and all social media. She dumped you. It's over.
You are not well-informed. Their policy is in accordance with language used in ITS OWN platform, not elsewhere. So no.
You can still check your feelings and then see how they’re messing up your facts.
> it’s a low f-ing bar lbr It is indeed. But I am glad that you found a man who doesn't want anal.
Ah yes, the United States Mutant Ninja Turtles. They would dominate every sport.
I was a huge fan of the script ones but the new greens this season look pretty fresh on ice, too. I like bringing the red back in
Because nothing he says was remotely sexist? Sure it could have escalated but what he said was pretty tame.
I broke contact after 6 months. It happens to the best of us. Get back on the proverbial horse.
I don’t even go through a period and I’m still crippled by random cramps
"I'm not going to date him...I love him to death." -[NAME] in the same sentence
Thanks, I was confused, too. I was like, "how did your grandma rinse vegetables??" Lol
Because your very wise mother KNEW who the real wankers were and she couldn't be bothered... Smart lady.
No, she's standing in the water after she pees.
They are unable to think out of the box
i’m so sorry.....
Incredibly laborious task. They look like they're handling it pretty well though...
The one coach I didn't want to lose, but with a new offense coming in, not a move i'm entirely shocked by.
Idk is this is a lie or something, but I’ve heard people say that over 1500 independent observers found the elections free and fair
Your friend should be disowned by their family
What a greedy person. 8 years jail and hopefully disgraced out of his profession.
There is clear video of them harassing people before any confrontation.
This is a great coming out, I also which it went this well for everyone 🏳️‍🌈
Thanks, I'll resubmit
Worst dad ever!
I wholeheartedly agree with you. I suspect that children this age don't quite understand this
Am I the only one that wants to see your art?? I love calligraphy! You might have a client here!!
If it comes out that [NAME] or [NAME] were sexual predetors I am going to be pretty god damn upset.
I hate when that happens.
She probably has a kid by now.
Avoid. Without a contract he can kick you out at short notice any time And when you pay a deposit make sure it's protected.
This is a very good point, which I hadn't thought of. Thanks dull!
That is always a black box to fans too - let’s say they pull the trigger, we have no idea if any of these reports are real
Not necessarily. Simply giving both of them the legal right to choose to *not* be a parent would create equality within the constraints of biology.
He's just showing off for the camera there.
Oh [NAME] that's terrible. I hope things are better for you now.
> Waaah the reward I get for being a decent human being isn’t good enough.
Same. Gives me the attention and love feelings that humans have failed to give
I like this plan. Hope [NAME] and [NAME] do too.
She barely has any real hair on her head. She looks like [NAME] dolly from Rugrats. Bet
And I’ll be there!!!
Oh ok I never watched that show. I love that judge though.
“I was half a virgin when I met him!” —[NAME]
This ain’t his first plank war
yes. to the above number i provided :) hope it’s helpful!
I still hated the system though. I felt penalized for using anything that wasn't the power beam the entire game.
then explain to me why everytime I post reply to u/955bsp, in an old post, you start spamming me
I'm baffled
>a water molecule spends around 600 years in Lake Superior. I guess it takes a while lol
^ but she ain’t a traitor
I'm surprised no one posted a Meat thread yet...
You die > mom will be sad
im glad they have it but this should have really been introduced in DMC3
Alright we have worn them down enough guys.
It has been a good snow and bad avalanche season in the rockies. Haha, thin and tight, just how i like‘em.
At least she's not a dirty little hamster.
They don't want to date you, they want you as a furry sex toy
I thought it was gen 2 that was affected by the dead batteries due to the internal clock?
They fetishize our oppression. Different day, same tune.
This thread is being brigaded by atheist/agnostics. They are just here to cause trouble. Look at OPs post history.
How did they respond? You can't leave out the best part.
He figured it out this offseason. He just didn't have any chemistry deep with his receivers and didn't know the playbook
I’m also glad I’m not the only one that swears a lot at the bastard objects.
I’m on it. Will be recruiting family and friends as well. Thank you 🙏🏻
Women punish men who ***openly*** process their emotions.
So it’s somehow weird or different to make a child/student pick up their (there) own mess as part of the lesson?
I liked the slug :(
Omg [NAME] he’s there because you don’t listen. You ass!
Lol kill me now
Chances are you’ll be playing against potato players that are worse than bots, so I think you’ve got it in you.
oh, me too, actually.
Yikes I cringed hard
But he's relieving pressure. Just count yourself lucky he doesn't cough when he farts.
Don’t let them get you down man. Nothing wrong with a cozy night at home by yourself.
Because he's attractive. Hence [NAME] come out in droves to defend him despite the fact he's a horrid asshole.
That's probably a good idea. Call them and see if they can help you.
I always hope that a woman will ask me out...next time it happens will be the first.
Me too!!!
You dont put it in the wastebasket. You put it on your Dad's nightstand.
Some people just need reassurance that they are, in fact, dumb.
What is his endgame? People are talking about him but this just makes him look bad.
Problem is as soon as someone criticises Israel they jump up and down and scream anti semitism
Is there some scripture you could quote me? I'd like to read up on it just to be sure for myself
Omg I'm crying and shaking rn [NAME] would never say that
Last game I think someone said it well, "[NAME] like a toddler in an NBA Pro's body.
NOW she needs that scotch tape
All armed robbers, serial killers, rapists, swindlers all downplay the severity of their actions...
Unbelievable that we didn’t sign him Also, we could’ve potentially signed [NAME] the window we signed [NAME]. Kill me.
Exactly hate when people try to spit facts when they don’t know if those facts are even right😂😂
Yeah, assuming what he said is true yes he has a chance, but it's hard to say for sure given the circumstances
I'm not surprised to read this within the sub it's in. Bunch of knuckle dragging storm troopers WOULD be angry to see people liberate themselves. XD
Ahh mate, come back any time and i'll make culturally inappropriate Third Reich gags and then we can get lit on bush chooks.
We tried, the place I go is just a rundown old town trashy high school filled with kids who have the background to shoot the place up
Try to contact [NAME] on Twitter. She is well known for such things. And the good thing is she is the external affairs minister of India.
> he might not have seen the truth by the time he had posted the video That's kinda the *whole fucking problem.* Fake Motherfucking News
He has become that which he swore to destroy!
Oh he dead
The only time petty revenge backfired lol at least from what I understood unless I missed something
He probably misread it as *gunst*, he didn't come here for gunst.
A site was the good site on old cobble, so they changed it and left the awkward B site alone. Thanks volvo
depending on his age there might still be hope. brain development supposedly stops around age 25 so if he gets ample simulation and nutrients perhaps there can be hope
Yep, it is public and others waiting for their case are there.
Omg i hope this is about [NAME]. I would LOVE to see [NAME] and [NAME] go head to head
I thought this was going to be a fierce, competitive game... how wrong I was.
If you are not worried about stranger danger I could probably give you a lift.
If you were better than the players you met every day you would be able to get better stats while playing against them.
Soundboard operator needs to start blasting duck quacks whenever we block their guys
Whenever I have felt it would work. I wasn't always right but it never hurt to ask.
She eats it until she throws up the first snows of the year. After that she just likes to play catch with it and roll in it.
Talk to a psychologist. Sorry but they can help if you think you have a problem
Please tell me your shop didn't get you in trouble for that D:
She would betray her friends for chicken nuggets
Can I comment on the lost opportunity/remarkable restraint by [NAME] to not have a "MLK I Have a Dream Mattress Sale"
oh [NAME] what did i do
He's a sexist piece of shit regardless so
I’m not sure even know sits a fucking painter’s tool. I hate everything about everyone in this video.
Don't feed into it. He knows exactly what he's doing. It's on purpose.
The older I get the more I just want to sit and be still on psychs
He's played the best ball of his life the past few weeks. Didn't see this coming though
That doesn't mean they're impossible. Minnesota's 7th district is 64% rural, R+12, and represented by [NAME], a [NAME].
Worst case scenario here is he dodged a psychopathic bullet.
Whoa! Very impressive. One of the better photos of Brisbane I've seen in a while.
There's a guy that died after he let a horse do that. He'd probably have survived if he sought medical attention sooner.
I can't imagine how scary that was for you. What is wrong with people?
The only reason people are there is because they dont know [NAME] is fired lmao.
I am nitpicking out of interest , but I don’t understand how cannibalism of deceased persons is immoral. Do you think it is immoral?
I love in SoSpaHa - south of Spanish Harlem.
you get an upvote for that username! I wish I was a funhammer
That and hoping the cultists on trumps side can give them enough time to get out before it all goes down in flames, your country that is.
I just got the zc and season pass for bo3 and have only played solo. Loving the game though.
i meant that either one has no scientific backing and was just made by random people, knowing how much people love lables
Well, ok then nevermind. I'm surrounded by people I mostly disagree with, but I honestly don't know anyone that I would call outright evil.
😢 Happy Birthday [NAME]! She had an amazing role model growing up!
Wow I bet someone would look at this and get inspired to make a movie about aliens with [NAME]
Yasssss. I loathed Harry Potter. Book? Movie? Toy? Board game? Costume?
He looks like [NAME]
Let's hope he doesn't change his mind.
Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers... I never saw the movie, myself. I thought it looked pretty stupid.
Yeah, that was terrible. [NAME] laughing and joking at the end of that game ended his career here.
I took it for a year. Had that problem before, during and after. May be coincidental timing for it to start being noticeable.
They didn't get magically transported from another life and retain all their memories and tendencies. So it's not apples to apples.
I sure hope so! Smug bastards!
[NAME]: "She seems useless"
Well I got checked at the last Toulon game haha, so not the case.
Go easy on your mom; this letter sounds like it was written from a place of deep love.
I go 2x on all semiauto
I think I could watch an entire show with just these two all the time.
I’d give this comment a gold if I could!! Yes, as a husband here, there’s no better reward!
I don’t get it. Does r/sardonicast actually believe that BP is highly overrated?
That little smile at the end is exactly why she looks fun.
"They hated [NAME] because he told them the truth."
This is the one picture that gives me mad inferiority complex.
I haven't laughed that hard to keep at or somehow gets the power of flex tape, I sawed this boat in half".
What a totally innocent and integral part of our society! So glad our tax money can keep him company over his year long holiday!
Who would have thought people were going to be using the Padres for their fake news to generate clicks. This is nuts.
Great protest! Not being discouraged by the weather or paternalistic criticism, good on them!
Or at least a couple more visits to the booth. I enjoyed hearing him adding to the banter.
Calm down. What the hell. I just tryed to tell you that there MEIGHT be a different side to that story.
multicultural makeup'? There's the indigenous people, the [NAME], and the illegal settlers, don't make me laugh
In good news today: she broke up with him!! Right after he told her he’ll never love her the way she loves him 🙄
The Colts badly wanted to hire him. He’d get a GM job in a heartbeat if he wanted it.
Even for an infidelity sub this is heavy. I hope you find peace somehow.
I reported you :-) Expect to find your comment deleted within a few hours :-)
The only person I didn't want was [NAME], and I ended up getting [NAME]...
Technically, going 1 forward and five backwards is still a 4 step backward defecit so they are not moving forward
Huh. So it really comes down to looking at her senate career vs her AG career.
Hey! Your mom sucks.
This has worked for me so many times, whenever I try to make a new habit I try to maintain it for 2 weeks and then it becomes routine
Of course. It would mean you owe them an unspecified favor in the future. That would be horrible.
Maybe they want to be a show couple ?
After 6 weeks, anything becomes a habit I hear.
I really like this play on words.
Just wondering how they did it visually with all the fireworks going on
She's not curating her humor to your taste, alas.
I thought this was about [NAME] from Melbourne bc of the flair, until I started reading it.
Once it became clear I was too old to have a family, yeah, it felt too old to bother with it.
i mean yeah but people need to understand when someone needs something other than just sexual comments and maybe some actual support
She probably has a kid by now.
He's hot
