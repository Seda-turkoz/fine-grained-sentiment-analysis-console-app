You seem pretty upset about this. It's not an email it is a formal filing. It doesn't surprise me you don't understand that though.
I definetly love some epistemology!
From Rockledge, Florida in the united states. Don't know why I ended up here to be honest but it's a good time.
I like that we get to see how varied artists are.
Oh I see
I know it's like this hipster phrase it's so stupid like you're not from the south you dumb motherfuker.
I’m glad I had a few margaritas before I read this
I'm two weeks in, hope your right, I'm loving the game right now
That’s very unfortunate for the bosses. Capitalism sure does commit genocide. Ireland. India. Indonesia. Vietnam. Iraq. Should I name more?
No but I've been totally been meaning to I fricking love [NAME]!
I feel like there's some shenanigans in place here.
Well unless you have an audio recording, people are gonna struggle to diagnose it for you any further I’m sorry.
I supported a third party lunatic. Huge difference.
I love Wood Witch, still saving to buy that.
I'm know Ashtabula. I'm from Lorain. That's cool that the company got bigger though.
Great story, but I'm on PC and didn't get a chance to play ;c.
I never knew this! Nuts are a total fear food for me
I just relapsed after a 15 day streak.
So $0.50 for that GIF? I think I'll pass.
I'm a [NAME]. FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED RHINESTONES!!! Edit: hmmmm
I’m not a fan of that hire at all... I’m also not a fan about how that all came out. All around bad.
Look at me! I care about animals!
I audibly gasped
I’m dying! Perfect!
Bold of you to assume that I have two other friends
Congrats I’m very happy for your happy ending. Wish you guys many many years of happiness together
I don't care about [NAME] story but I surprisingly found myself liking Bristol's.
I mean China, India, and Pakistan have nukes and won't exactly take being exterminated lightly.
What is it that we don't know yet about the Rebellion, if you don't mind me asking?
That is interesting. Can you site some sources or anything on this matter ? I am genuinely intrigued .
omg i cant believe that nifty is still a thing
YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH WHEN YOU’RE TALKIN’ TO ME!
I don't believe no one in your class thought of Mac or iPhone.
I haven't seen a single [NAME] article. But there have been a few [NAME] articles around recently.
I don't know exactly why, but I think [NAME] would really dig on [NAME]. [NAME] would go for the Death Wish movies.
Glad you’re doing better internet stranger, and I hope you continue to know peace and happiness. Be well.
Most people don't believe I have aspergers because I look 'normal' everyone else just thinks I'm weird.
Thank you. This sub is the one place I feel understood
I enjoy cycling too much lol
Me too, [NAME]. Me too.
Oh of course,this bag will still be thoroughly enjoyed . Modern times have just turned me into a snob
I have a 4.95 rating and it did not go down after tonight's riders. Everybody I drove was a talkative l, drunk and merry group.
As will myself and everyone else who is able to leaving the poorest to fend for themselves. Or we revolt like the [NAME]. Edit: grammar
Jobby is a new one for me, is that another way of saying taking a crap?
Thousands of people born every single day! But mine? Mine's a god damned miracle!
I can't see anything wrong with this message
Omg I thought it said it aired the 7th. I feel dumb. Ty.
This is the funniest thing I’ve seen today
> I don't care what context this has Why are you so proud of being ignorant?
I second that
I've been playing this game since release and didn't even know that!
Is this for an open carry? Or will I be limited to just owning at home, which is what I want anyway.
I want Cowboys and Bears to win so the Raiders draft picks are at best picks 25 & 26
[NAME] is not a guy I root against. Just hope we have a good enjoyable game
Wow, I'm sorry you had to deal with that. I trust better things are coming for you.
Oh man I was being facetious It annoyed me so much
I'm down for cuddling too uwu ^(especially since cuddling can lead to sucking OwO)
I just draw for the fun of it tbh... But having "success" or getting recognition still surely feels nice... Don't give up :)!
I’m gonna stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes! Maybe that’ll teach you a lesson.
THERE'S A WAR COMING, NED. I DON'T KNOW WHEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO WE'LL BE FIGHTING...BUT IT'S COMING!
Idk that looks like adobe gains to me..
I wonder what was stopping that barber using the lightning network for payments?
Knew you weren't from here. I don't believe your story though.
I always feel so bad for [NAME] when I watch this scene.
I play until madden comes out, play mut until I get burnt out then go back to mlb when it comes out
I hope barely anyone watches it, it's so aggressive, full of cringe and makes him look childish
Damn you, [NAME]. I’m a woman and yours are bigger than mine. It’s not fair!
I honestly really think tumblr should’ve gotten rid of everything but legal porn
"I'm a libertarian. I get attacked by both sides lol" "I voted [NAME] last election" Uhhhh what
I STILL WANT CREW ONLY LOBBIES
Watch it in German but use English subtitles trust me
I don't care it's amazing there lol
I just unassigned and left
Now that is a valid opinion unlike your other ones. Unless you didn’t read all of what I said.
No hate TGR I love you
I don't think you should ever be forced to do any work, so obviously not.
A classic. I have these.
When I was in high school, a girl told me I looked like [NAME] from The Little Mermaid. *Ouch*
This is the most beautiful story I've ever heard.
Is there something I'm missing here? I don't see the pun.
[NAME]. i love it
Ok, I gots to know, was the child taken away? Please tell me the child was taken away.
I agree it seemed very odd the whole live stream...
I swear to [NAME], these offseason dream/hypothetical lineups get me rock solid every single time. I love it
>How do you know I didn't Because you posted this dumbass post. And only someone who didn't would say that
Reddit I’m blind, what’s the bottom right?
I guess [NAME] are especially good at making heaven sound boring 😂. I'm also an [NAME]
Maybe I have the mind of a child but I found that entertaining like I’d upvote it if I just saw it
I want commit die
[NAME] is the queen. The dispossessed is a great work of anarchist science fiction, and where I first came across anarchism portrayed positively.
I read TFTFD periodically, too - - I wasn't sure if the Mods there would leave the post up or tell LAOP to post on r/AskHotel instead.
Sometimes when it gets super annoying I cut it off with scissors but it always turns out worse and makes all the surrounding ones irritated and sore
Couldn't have said it better myself
ah, i see. yeah it’s true that the title does seem pretty flippant, though maybe the article itself is better?
I feel like the world just doesn’t want [NAME] to have the spotlight. This is torture for a [NAME] fan like me. :’(
I have but one upvote to give, otherwise you would get more.
I thought legends already started.
It would be an atrocity to bring him back, I think the F.O will be forced to bring in someone else.
I just realized people in apartments are essentially screwed, that is too bad man, hopefully you'll get that going soon! It's worth it!
Sweet [NAME] I'd be psyched to get [NAME]. I do *not* believe that will happen though.
I was under the impression that [NAME] also has some pretty rough health problems.
Exactly. I have yet to see a plus sized model without a blemish-free, conventionally attractive face.
Ok. Progress. Not only I presented more facts, I also asked some questions. Still unanswered, sadly.
I don’t get it. We should just trade our bad players for other teams good players. Smfh /[NAME]
I wish it was only -25. -45 where i am.
The comments made by [NAME] to Truth on Smackdown about [NAME] makes me really think [NAME] has an outside chance at the win
I'm sure this is only because there's less people there
“But [NAME] wants you to have kids!” [NAME] should have given me ovaries then lol
Thanks, I'll resubmit
I love [NAME] but its been 1 year
I'm sure you'd be the first one to run towards a crazy guy with a power tool.
I got laid the first time directly after that game too Not sure if there's a correlation, just thought I'd contribute
Those fingers disturb me the most
This just proves you put the bone there, I'd actually be impressed if you showed him putting the bone there
I literally didn’t know that it was a interlocked I and U. Holy cow that’s crazy.
I came here to say this.
I see, I can't see it. I'm on mobile. Thank you very much for the info. Have a lovely Wednesday afternoon!
That's great to hear. I hope you get it, and have many years with that job.
Happens to me sometimes too in certain scenarios. Its frustrating especially when you're banking on it deflecting something.
Oh my [NAME] I forgot about that movie
Lol i love this person
I don't bother diagnosing it in people with BPD. The handful of genuine DIDs that I was referring to were people who didn't have BPD.
I agree. This is assault. Leave the ignorant hill [NAME] alone.
I laughed way harder then i shouldve
Rural MO. The nearest Whole Foods is an hour away. I can't imagine too many [NAME] could handle the distance.
I’d say every of those subreddits are freaking out but it’s basically the same people lol
Really? That's interesting. I'll have to give it a try. Yes I'd love to take a look at your suggestions.
Fuck i think I whooshed myself
I can’t even count how many times I heard “you always have to be right”
Hey! I was hoping to get as close to face value as possible.
It's good to know that I'm not the only one lol
This hit me a little too close to home
I moved to Canada in 2001 from the middle east. I'm still not used to it. I hate cold.
I waited 15 days for this joke, I'm so proud of this community.
[NAME] was pretty cool on The Challenge so I would love to see him on CBB.
I'm the one who died inside here
CAN IT JUST BE OPENING DAY? I’m so sick of speculation. Let’s quit the foreplay and just fuck already.
I like how adamant you are that you didnt woosh yourself
Even assuming that it's possible to take nothing, god DAMN I feel bad for anyone that has to look at the second dude's head during sex
¯_(ツ)_/¯ I think its cool.
Honestly I would have no idea if it weren't for the logo. This is unholy.
This really feels like a jab at [NAME] as opposed to a reconciliation. Hope I'm wrong.
I love [NAME] so much
I'm sorry but this sounds very much purposeful. How exactly is headbutting someone an accident?
What, we are all gonna be corpses soon. Do I become that sooner?
i just don’t think we are aggressive 100% of the time
Yep. I did this in uni, got mad respect for holding my "booze".
I wake up with a smile knowing that there are almost 5 billion WHAMEN to RESPECC in the world
i was in that thread, but i can at least admit it ;)
I wish non-BPD people understood the pain of a relationship ending like we do. It's crippling and lasts forever.
I recognized a word!
I am an older guy just trying to meet good chat buddies. Pm me if interested
I’m excited to experience Denver for the first time! All I’ve heard is how amazing it is
Ah the classic "I don't deserve you" argument.
Those bastards lied to me
Tell me when you find out how to bowser-wobble
Oh I love me some winter depression
I believe this would still be a ticket if someone else sees you.
It gave me a laugh. xD
Can you imagine being taken to court over a flushing loo? I can’t believe the courts are even entertaining this.
Oh shit why didn't I think of that?
I had no idea. Is this recent?
I don't even care about the draft, I've tasted playoff hopes and I'm not going back.
When I was in Uni I worked in a call centre. Pay was better than retail but it was worse on the soul.
I hate people.
I legitimately had a hard time believing such terrible people exist until I encountered one for myself!
Honestly mate, highest I've got to is only 1623 but put me up against an axe or a cannon and I'm just dead.
That's a great point that I never thought of before... possibly nobody has!
I mean [NAME] rookie of the year thing. Lol am dumbass Just a misunderstanding.
Except the rest of the scoreboard is in blue (score and time) or white (team names). I did figure it out but certainly not straightforward
Don’t be saucy with me, mister! I ain’t Alfredo you!
I have [NAME] hat so I could marry it, flip it and kill it
Despite what you may feel about me, I’m happy you got that off your chest, I hope you feel better!
I think Limmy's Show is really hit and miss. Some sketches are funny, others are just poor.
All I saw was [NAME]
Baby's face: "I've been bamboozled!
I like how it's also a subtle girls>guys
Shouldn't be getting downvoted that's exactly what I thought the motive was
I wish I loved anything the way [NAME] loves playing hockey
I think you may just be an asshole/moron bud... sorry.
I know, right? What an embarrassment that local news would call that thing a "tractor".
Is this in New Orleans?? I really feel like this is New Orleans.
And I though Glory Kills were gruesome
i find it a little disgusting if swear words are used frequently and unironically.
80k/month? Damn. I need to become a Union Square store
Being bullied is what taught me I wasn't wanted anywhere.
Sorry, I don’t see a difference. If you are opposing people’s access to something, your opposing that thing.
I got a girl's number at work and we're dating now so all girls aren't like this lol
I hope all of y'all that are commenting isn't all men because not all women do that!
Oh btw this was me yesterday, commenting on that "ugly" ban!
"LOOK AT ME!!"
I mean it has history and culture which Boston rather lacks.
I don’t want everybody to live the same way as me, I just wanted to express the stupidity of it.
Nah, you should have just listened when I tried to warn you about fake
I feel like this should be a copypasta... It's correct and I want the message to be spread...Can we make this a thing lol
I didn't see anything in that comment referring to a cactus.
It took a surprisingly long time for this to be seen by me on this sub.
I hate this.
I know this was a common thing, but never knew that were so many creative names for it until I read this thread.
I carry 2 small stuffable throw blankets and a sweatshirt. Sweatshirt to ensure warmness. Blankets to ensure cuddles. I’ll let you know if it ever works.
You're asking for scientific proof of spirituality. You're either very dumb, trolling, or you think I'm a charlatan.
People will go mental hoarding food, so you should be hoarding food, not like those idiots that panic. I'm confused.
Reminded me of this Bizarro comic.
I agree with your statement.
Yup like 40/60 for me
I once got one missing half a wafer. So delicious.
Sounds exactly the same as GC to me?...
Ugh I wish!!! You’re not in the US?
Me neither. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Freaky mind of mine!
Yeah, life in America is horrifying. Give me a break.
I had the same problem
Thanks for explaining it to me! I did have an adaptor thing to connect to HDMI, I will double check tonight
Excuse me... I have to return some videotapes.
Oh I wasn't offended. ITA with you on the rest.
this is killing me LMAO
I’m not going to get in to the boring details here, but... Too late.
Yes,on top of that feel like vomitting,can't breathe and thinking I will faint.
I haven't watched the original FMA, but you're definitely in for a fun ride with Brotherhood. Hope you enjoy it!
I'm sorry but are you implying that everything to the right of full-blown communism is the center?
Shit okey I think I’m ready
Thanks! I was probably going to look in the Midwest
Um....Yes? I would love it if everyone didn't believe in [NAME].
Wow that’s weird. I’m too used to that age group complaining about “kids these days”. Thanks for sharing.
One of the better shutdown memes I've seen. Have an upvote.
Look I also love dragons, but this is just not a dragon, ok? Have some Toothless *hugs*.
As QA I can confirm that I have no idea what I'm doing
So I did. Good call.
I'd feel better if the dude in the video didn't have a gun.
Feeling bit better now, but the feeling as a whole will come back I know.
Got it! I wasn't aware that it was a slur, and thought that it was just a general term used. Thanks for the info.
This is a bit of a political post but I just felt like venting.
Honestly I’ve seen kids that age do really gross stuff
Idk what tf that is😂.... Don’t hate me guys!
Thank you for contributing your weird suggestion, I love it.
I watched that same movie. Very generic Christmas movie but I liked it
I see One Punch Man is on quite the rampage
horse meat is fucking peng i love it. why is it ok for a cow to be slaughtered for food but not a horse? ridiculous double standards
Makes me want to go shit on the doorstep of 540 Hampshire Street (Good2go HQ)
For what it's worth, I hope you have a great year anyway.
Yeah more and more I play BFV I just find myself wishing this thing or that thing was more like the old BF’s.
This is awful and borderline abuse. I can't imagine thinking that's even slightly okay
Yeah I read about what happened last week
Yes, that is correct. I knew what you meant though:)
Understood - PM was all gears and no downtime. Last thing I would want is another bloody job like that. Cheers
Yeah, for sure. I've definitely come pretty close to panic attacks at the dentist as well.
I said nothing of the sort.
Well that's why I'm reading up on the scientific research available. It's possible that it could mean that
For a second there I read the subreddit as "furry and sad". Pretty disappointed.
Agreed, but it took me a while to understand that.
This is very helpful, I'll dive into these links thanks
Not me personally, but I do think it's an excellent idea. You never know when a stomach bug might hit.
I don't want a president who doesnt know anything about foreign affairs....no thanks.
In what ways has [NAME] out-coached [NAME]? I see this all the time and yet never any examples.
Didn't Canada have more guns per capita then USA? I think I saw that in Bowling for Columbine. But [NAME] seem pretty chill about it.
If you have schools in your city, I got bad news for ya champ...
The 2nd worst president. First time i voted. Been trying to live it down ever since
Damn, I hope that lady unloaded the rest of the bread and cleared out like a fart in the wind before homeslice came back.
/u/flight2-0-9er and I have been having a conversation about it
But i like being the trickiest of traps 😣
That's so horrible. I am so sorry that you had to endure that abuse. I hope that you have a bed that you love now.
While I agree with you for the most part, I also have cats and upholstered furniture.
I'm laughing hysterically at midnight Thanks LMAO
I have yet to see someone apologize for having bad english who actually has bad english.
Oof I’m glad this was the top post bc I literally came here to post it after seeing it on Facebook
Okaaaay? I'm not sure how to respond to that, no offense.
I'm hopeful but going in with tempered expectations. There have been some remasters in which I was really disappointed. BioShock comes to mind.
Perhaps you are right and the stereotype that ASD people are math savants may not be as true as I thought 🤔
Because it’s a lot for someone to handle and i haven’t had any outbursts etc that would’ve resulted from that
Nah, I knock on the door from inside, or the wall, or tap the floor, seems easier
I hate when that happens.
I'm sorry for what happened to you. I guess you were sending mixed signals all the time.
this is killing me LMAO
I hope Dallas gets close and loses in heartbreak.
>I get that.. You don't
I feel personally attacked. Every time one little thing happens, part of me just collapses inside.
Who said i was a kid?
OK, so I still primarily blame the US. What's your point?
It makes me feel better about overeating sometimes because I tell myself that at least I’m not as bad as those people
I only watched a few episodes, but I loved that guy.
Someone may have mineswept it after we left for all I know...*shudders thinking about it*.
I almost downvoted you, because “Boooooooo!”
I tried to write a cheque for a fare when I was a teenager. That did not go down well.
Anyone going to The Federal in North Hollywood tonight? I’ve never been and I’m wondering what the crowd will be like.
I like how it's "unacceptable" lol. The nerve
Wait, wut? I thought there was some sort of (2) term pledge from
I guess so ¯_(ツ)_/¯
I’m just shitposting dude. In the spirit of the thread “I was bored”
I was inspired by your post to grab a thing of Greek yogurt with pineapple I've got in the fridge. Hell yeah.
Here in the UK I’m pretty sure I’ve never seen a taco
I you use a /s .... Don’t know what to say to you m8...
Thanks for sharing. I've actually been to the Allen.
I’m not arguing for it. I just think the punishment doesn’t fit the crime.
The main reason I left is a hidden mmr used to influence matchmaking in a mode that requires a paid entry. That's disgusting
I could upload this to YouTube if I wanted to. No problem. You couldn’t do anything.
Ah yes of course, how could I have been such a Horseshoe crab!
Guys. I think OP blew burns in college and wants to feel better about it.
I kept hoping [NAME] would walk out and shame DG.
I like how it's also a subtle girls>guys
Has anyone actually read the terms of service. I haven’t...😔 Is this a valid reason to break the contract I signed?
I just gave you a quote direct from the current finance minister regarding the supply. Get real, man.
