No worries. Just didn't see them. My bad.
WHO WON THIS FIGHT My thoughts: neither side did a good job at explaining their positions and this entire interview was mostly useless
Me too. It’s my favorite. His cadence in saying it is so perfect lol.
INTP or not, that’s the universal language of interest, at least in my book.
Yeah, this is always my first thought when I read this kind of stuff, kinda sad to be honest
I agree with everything you said. I still fell sad for her but this is the consequences of her own choices
The ones who supported ETC were more concerned with negatively impacting Ethereum and it's community than the DAO rollback in my opinion.
I think the saddest thing here is that he thinks "by-my-self" is how to write that.
My dad doesn’t believe in climate change. This is way too accurate.
Me too! I don't believe in likes or karma points, but I know other people care and it might be the highlight of their day.
Looks like my greyhounds feet
You have been rewarded my friend.
aw thank you, I want to get rid of some of my extra things and eat food with less packaging
I needed to hear this. I'm resigning my good paying FT soul sucking job to try something new. Wish me luck!
> I thought he didn't actually collect the second He lost the second imo.
I would totally park in front of their house. They have as little right to complain as you do.
there's a thai restaurant in my husband's hometown that makes pad thai delicious enough to make me cry. i look forward to it every time we visit
I'm just glad we'll be getting either [NAME] or [NAME]. They both seem like they'll be beasts and it'll fill our greatest position of need
I have a paper yardstick from IKEA in my purse. It has been very helpful for the craziest of reasons.
If they were good at it, I'd love it.
My earliest memory is being in a wooden crib and my mom screaming in my face at the top of her lungs. It didnt end there.
I think she means he was her boyfriend for 5 months
Wow dad, you took a baptismal for me
How did they know it was seafood? What did I miss? Thats awesome btw
Now I hate the giants as much as the next but they're 4th in average attendance and percentage.
beautiful story arc. glad you decided to end it in my semi hometown of excelsior - really neat lil town.
Is there proof this happened or is it just her accusation? I'm asking because we already know she's a liar.
Damn. I didn't realize they just aren't getting paid right now.
i believe he has a minor ankle injury at the moment, i’m not too worried about his skating
They are dangerous AF. I had a student faceplant and break her face, and my daughter's friend hit his head and is in a coma.
In the 50s my aunt was 6 weeks old when a flu virus caused inflammation of the heart and she died. So there's that, too.
We finally lost a game while I was shuffling my tarot deck and now I can’t decide if I should try again or if the luck ran out
OK thanks 😂 I just typed she automatically and then realized I had actually no idea if she was a she hahaha
Cinesphere and Trillium Park are both fantastic spots and I see absolutely zero reason to change them.
I mean, she actually is a genius, so I really dont have a problem with her identifying herself as one
Yes. She should. Just not President. I've heard people say she should, and she is nowhere near ready for that.
I believe you. Have you compared them to any other designs of headphones in the same price range though?
I feel bad for all those kids whose parents decided to homeschool them so they could be professional HOTS players without all that stupid learning getting in the way.
The problem is that data shows graphics sell, gameplay doesn't. It really sucks though, I wish they gave us a toggle at least
I’m this close to buying a tweezer and doing my own eyebrows but I’m fully aware it’s the masculinity stopping me lmao.
"brush my back again, I dare you, I double dare you."
No, I mean that each single individual will commonly use contradictory arguments just to satisfy his comment-du-jour. Everyone but incels realizes it.
Damn straight! My folks only knew when I told them about it!
I like the mountain of health and guts thing about shugoki. Wouldn't mind if he get even more health
I love that this Subreddit has so many good food suggestions! I'm kinda new to the area and still getting my bearings.
As a teacher with a bunch of sick students, this scares the hell out of me.
I wonder if the paintings he did on Brooklyn 99 were actually his.
I wish, the brainwashed idiots here in California love her. It makes me sick. California is a lost cause.
Do you know my ex husband? You sound so much like him according to his old coworkers.
I know plenty of [NAME] that look down on 中国人 Like they’ve forgotten the whole reason Singapore exists
Either way, I am afraid his marriage is over. She doesn't respect him anymore...
It’s a shame, I’ve had numerous friends with disabilities but I’ve never treated them any less then my friends without.
My bad.
No, mom doesn’t like fights and my sisters afraid of getting hit (even though he doesn’t hit her)
I have a straight Lebanese friend (girl) and this happens all the time.
Oh I can't wait until they have sole rights to our game.
i wish i could wear what she's wearing! * _ * Sooooo beautiful!
Hell yeah! I can't wait for the rust to break off and for people to be as excited as they were years ago.
amendments are allowed on monday to mays deal, i'd be amazed if no one kills her deal
AS AN ITALIAN MAFIA ONCE SAID "LOOK HOW THEY MASSACRED MY BOY"
I feel like I might sneeze and accidentally set off my Typhoon defense system. That could be catastrophic.
Yeah I love can ox, but they should stay in small indoor venues or something. Their music is better for that anyway. Cold vein is classic
I work at an R1 university, with most of my team composed of CS/CE undergrad students. Yes, I've known many...
More interested in getting responses to my questions rather than cryptic clues! Not sure of the relevance of your question.
the knock off names are super cringey but i love looking for them
That's what i was thinking. Did she tell you she did?
If you don't understand that question then you be receptive to any of my ideas.
Very kind and calm female here. Never yell or say/do anything to hurt anyone. I once threw a chair at my boyfriend. Completely out of character.
Right? Doesn't even stand a chance against my milk 80% of the time
I told you, he’s not a menace!
I never said you did? I'm just going off the conspiracy that's been going around for awhile about her being a clone
Yes I am. Not sure other than to give me your best answer. Yes, walking in your moccasins is my goal. Thank you.
I put Norilsk on my phone so I feel better when Chicago is crazy cold
It was my impression that Monzo doesn't offer business bank accounts?
Oh I quit flying with them last year. Good times though
Yea ur right on that but that doesn't really negate my statement on the blitz.
I mean if he’s into it, sure, whatever. I’m not one to judge.
Of course right as I came across this my mom texted me saying "I remember 2018 like it was yesterday"...
She’s sexy I’d hit.
I couldn't muster up the energy to read through it all. They're on a different level, and it's not a compliment.
You're welcome! And whoops, my bad. I did not know that, thank you. I edited it up above.
Thins are my favorite and I will not apologize. It makes the flavor of the cookie shine through.
I don’t understand your question, why are you nervous if you are happy with the arrangement and he seems interested?
I would say cmv and unpopular opinions have ended up being troll platforms, regardless of their intentions.
Yes! I love her laugh so much
Wow. My first comment here (I think) is met with hate! Ouch!
They can be upset about both. Believe me, I've heard the lecture about how Catholicism is a cult and the abortion tirade in the same sitting.
Obviously he has not adhered to his promises, however what I noticed is this is basically the same message that [NAME] had.
She looks like a petite adult to me, her face is obviously adult
My names Welsh and only 5 letters and even that is too hard for most people.
Yeah , yeah you can’t change my mind , you’ll get there eventually .
I love my Red Wings because they're incredibly stylish and I still feel like I could stomp a mudhole in somebody's ass
Amen! However, see my post about the problem with drafting [NAME]. If we do, [NAME] will probably be the odd man out.
My favorite is they didn't have time to eat healthy. Wut.
That what a highlight reel moment that will be played for years and years. That game is on my rotation of games. Great game all around.
I'd give it a 9/10 one of my favorites. So what was your thoughts on D'jango?
Oh perfect- I am surrounded by [RELIGION] and they LOVE those kinds of “parties”
I find it hard to say "no" to anyone, but I knew if I didn't, he would have done exactly what you said.
I don’t watch the Colts, but out of interest do they insist on making [NAME] block consistently like we did.
lol, I thought he might have been heading towards that direction with that too.
I too cuddle with this guy’s sister in law if his wife is tired
He rambles like a lunatic and she focuses on being called “not beautiful” of all things. Lol Uh oh I hear the downvote train a-comin’!
For real my wife was like what the hell are you laughing so hard at... I couldnt even explain i just kept laughing.
As a teacher it would be lovely to eat lunch in this room instead of where i do. GTAGE
I'm sorry. I hope he takes the CTJ talk seriously. Fingers crossed for you!
I doubt it, serial killers enjoy killing, the stuff they do afterwards is just the icing on the cake for them.
Yes the achilles gave out and so did my hopes. I miss brandon :(
They killed me [NAME]. They killed me with schlock
I dont think it will happen cuz he will probs just stay in GS or go LA with/ against [NAME] but I do think he should look into it.
The fingertip save against [NAME] in the Champions League Final shootout is forever etched in my brain. What a legend.
I’m not. I know too many moid larpers to be one. I’ll show you my face if you want.
I have seen people that have many mutual friends with me but I have no idea who they are. It happens.
Counteracting my cold soul takes sacrifice
Reminds me of my electric razor
I sincerely hope they'll take good elements from DMC 2 (outfits, [NAME]) and maybe make fun of DmC
If [NAME], upon becomming Premier actually funds solar, wind or other renewable energy projects with Government of Alberta money I will eat my tuque.
one of my all time favorite episodes i even love the closing animation of them crossing the bridge out of the
Don't let loneliness get in the way of growth. Grow my man, grow!
Okay, enough me being a great mom.
Correct. I just enjoy debating them.
"[NAME]" Still love [NAME], and while the actual [NAME] was cool at first, she's gotten pretty "meh" to me.
oh that's cool, I didn't know they already got sick time. It'll help a lot with retail workers who get dicked by shit scheduling
I pulled over at a Walmart on my way home from work to chat with all you beautiful faggots while I listen to the speech.
You dont know how much that boosted my self-esteem right now. Thank you stranger
Even [NAME] has said "I'm happy *for you*" to pregnant women he's known.
I love how he misses that last punch when he goes down lol. Like, thats when the liver shot really sunk in
I can't wait until I can get my app up and running now.
I'm not conflating anything, I'm describing my experience. I'm curious, where are you from? I'm in the rural south.
100% agreed. If wanting people to understand the meaning of my comment makes me a coward, then I don't wanna be fucking brave.
MY JOB IS NOT MY FRIENDSHIP CURRENCY
I became a member in the summer and have still not gotten my packet, your post just gave me hope it still might come
Well he abused his previous girlfriend, he ran a porn site that's what I know
i thought the comment i replied too was still talking about the OP's vid. [NAME] should have been my clue. my bad.
Oh I quit flying with them last year. Good times though
My worry about [NAME] is that running former governors hasn’t worked out the greatest. Especially when his been out of office for 11 years.
Jolex because [NAME] grated on my nerves so bad
The fact that they didn't double up on gronk on any key plays tells me they weren't playing against NE strength.
Hey now I masturbate in my own filth and I don't take kindly to being compared to these people.
For sure larrisa so I can try and bang her
Ya I sent one not too long ago.. I'll wait till my next try. Also I learned Sens a very crap selection for shot glasses.
Id be glad, I used to take those off when I was a kid. I dont want brightly colored rocks in my brownie
I make my cows super stronk.
That’s awesome! Good call :) settling my alarm now m/
That one is my favorite btw, its delicious. sorry you couldn't have it :(
That happened at my college, ofc TFM had to come in and brand it as their own. What a joke.
Got home from helping my friend move and turned it on literally just in time to see [NAME] score. Let's go Knights!
I'm sorry. I hope he takes the CTJ talk seriously. Fingers crossed for you!
I assume he likes it and wants to share what he loves.
Sold out. Sorry my dude!
Dont get stuck in deep thought too much or you could loose focus but i have no problem as long as my vision is not impaired.
he can still be heard uttering "I'm a huge fan" alone in a dark room
Holy shit it's almost like the PYD is a organization of Syrian citizens I can't believe he exposed them on that.
I don't get it. Are they upset that men aren't all using the blue nametags because blue is the color for boys, or what?
That’s sad, although I’m aware they historically haven’t been weaned off of authoritarianism.
I decreased my intake as she suggested, but she now says I am grounded
True. I'm not from the US so i dont know how they would go about enforcing this law.
I thought he was #25?
My man!
Wouldn't wipe my arse with it.
By far my favorite STP song and one of my all-time favorite songs in general. Love this song.
It's viewed as unfashionable and lower class. Personally I think they feel great. Who gives a shit what other people think?
I guess my story was too subtle. Alone on an indian burial ground after dark. It's literally the core of multiple horror stories.
I give you points for making me very surprised to see [NAME] up there. I'm glad he is.
This sounds like the kind of comment my weird uncle would leave on my Facebook post.
[NAME] was the "socialist" freshman House Rep. I liked the most, but her recent [NAME] tweets are extremely concerning.
Actually I got mine right when they were getting banned
My favorite thing is when [NAME] gets the ball at the top of the key and every stands with their hands on their hips
It looks a little like my 5th grade science experiment...
Oh, their theme gives me anxiety.
Yup those are the two worst tasting out of my cocktail!
Oh my, my Japanese course is paying off! Yes that's what I was trying to say 😄
I just have a controller on my desk that I turn on when I fly. I've always hated mouse flying.
"...but then some guy on internet promised, yes promised, that [NAME] existed, and it turned my life around". Dude, come on...
No! My furniture is floating!
Ever since I could squat, deadlift, and bench more than my father he never questioned my decision. haha
I love lists. And problem solvers. I need you in my life.
Damn that sucks dude! Personally I’d fill the soil with barbed wire so when they stick their hands in they’d get nice and cut up
I have been saying this for a long time, he is way overpaid and the forward position is our main weakness since [NAME] left.
AS AN ITALIAN MAFIA ONCE SAID "LOOK HOW THEY MASSACRED MY BOY"
If yoire voluntarily going to one I would argue that all those "side effects" i guess you would call them are already in your life.
Bro. You think roads and infrastructure wouldnt be built if it wasn’t for the government? My sentiment still stands. I pity you.
In the right photo, he looks like my friend's husband.
My father needs to read this! ...I may be wrong tho
We got a room full if potheads, were gonna need back up.” “I’M ON MY WAY!”
Same, ASMR is nightmarish. My skin crawls just thinking about it.
oh id love to hear it if you ever find it. he is one of my all time favorite authors
I think he actually isn't feeling well tonight. He left practice early yesterday because he felt light headed, [NAME] still put him in.
My father has been dead for two years and it's still been difficult to not talk about him as if he's still alive.
*Lente, otherwise a great song. Theme song to my varsity years
I just discovered her channel recently too! She's hilarious and I love watching all the diet tryouts.
yea I agree, and [NAME] is way younger so has trade value. [NAME] is still an offensive powerhouse but his DWAR is slumping.
I bet he paid, AND requested this masterpiece
I’ve thought about journaling. I think I’ll give that a try sometime soon. Thank you for your words my friend
[NAME] are you me? Like I was relating and then you said rot in Atlanta traffic and the pains of 285 burned into my mind.
Yeah I have no idea. I’m guessing she meant to ask for someone to “sit” with mama [NAME] in her place?
Back in my day the only bars you could find were real ones👴
okay for real, i saw this when the game ended. i died. i fucking died laughing. -sent from my HeavenPhone (TM)
It appeared that she smacked her grape pretty damn good. Oh, and I chuckled.
I love it, I understand they can't just get rid of [NAME] for her, but I would be so angry watching [NAME] boss her around.
I personally wish that they stuck with the spin offs but if their happy I’m good.👌
They cut a majority of the core coffees which makes my job harder as I'm in charge of the passports.
No fuck that guy. I'm actually relived he was shot. Sounds like a sack of human garbage
For some reason, I thought this was one of his Bros trying to save him from her.
I read this to my 17 year old brother and he was kinda pissed off just saying
I do have a feeling [NAME] will retire while [NAME] still has a season on his contract.
Papa Johns in my area basically gives away their pizza. I can smell the desperation in the store
Be great if the DV judge made her refund the cash to every single person, unlikely, but I can fantasize:(
I haven't confirmed this, but apparently, [NAME] said his trilogy fight with [NAME] sucked because he had an inflamed vagina.
I would get up and gently wake the guy-he could have broken his jaw-
I don't define myself by my sexuality. Conservatives who want to kill me do.
I bet he jerks off while holding a gun in his mouth while crying.
This made my day lol
Not to be harsh but I feel like she has been dieting and working out for quite some time .. wouldn’t there be some change by now ?
Stu if you ever say the Pats will beat my Chiefs again I will rain anarchy. BIG THROWS PAT IS GONNA DO IT.
No Akechi but I’ll take Ren. ([NAME] they’re all so good)
Seeing the Reverend talk to his son like that always made me feel uncomfortable but also mad.
Haha me too! I just told my husband they were my favs and I never thought that would happen with BOTH of them.
I love them too. That one is definitely my favourite. Here’s a close second. He speaks three ‘space languages’
What a fucking moronic jackass. "This is what happened with my piece of shit dad so you have to experience it too"
My guess? Porn. PIED.
I couldn't get my wife on board. She insists on eating a "real dinner".
And let me guess, is our friend [NAME] also shilling his own coin that solves all the problems?
wow I think you've really got her now
Just search her in this group you will find tons of info to see why people think that. I don’t have time to type everything out
favorite athlete of all time for sure. [NAME] and [NAME] are my other 2 haha. [NAME] up there for my own sanity
Bruh I don’t even have an IRA anymore all of my money is in silver, platinum, and stock options. TRUST NOBODY
I am in distance relationship so this probably me and my boyfriend for this valentine. This suppose to be our first valentine.
here for me scenes of [NAME] being dragged by her children
Thanks this was a cool article. The Shedd means a lot to me as it was where I went the first time I met the love of my life
"Lol, hold my craft beer."
Exactly, or they thought he was saying it jokingly. The delusion these men live with continues to amaze me
[NAME] is so rational, I’d just cry really hard if my parents spent all my college money 💰
I like how he wrote many of the TRUE [NAME]. I wonder what a fake [NAME] believes in.
Okay, thanks. Dont wanna get banned want my rewards from commendation thing.
She was literally the worst manager I’ve ever worked for
THE PACK RUNS DEEP AND HARD. I WOULD SHARE MY KRAFT MAC AND CHEESE WITH YOU ANY DAY. AROOOOOOOOO
I've started downvoting people for mentioning meat or animal products in their comments.
I dunno, I've found some of my holy grail products through bloggers.
She got me into it so not wrong lol
Im not looking to be forgiven lol. I still stand by what i said. Pll only read half my comment and ran with it
She likes sending nudes? I mean, just go with the flow and see what happens.
Now you're trying to push boundaries, get off my side of the fence
Drive thru is the worst. The number of times people would sneeze in my face at the window was infuriating.
Link pls, I need to see this! ( I bet he dropped it)
Man.. all I know is if I’m with a girl and she whips out a condom from her FUCKING SHOE it’s a no from me dog
"I love ya, Mom". Man, if I was his mom I'd knock him into next week.
I don't see a mom referring to a group chat as a "thread".
That’s what I’ve been doing lol but it’s one of my favorite maps and blood isn’t up to snuff with it
I fell asleep with the feeds on last night and woke up pretty frightened at the noises coming from my computer. Thank you for casting Tom BB hahahaha
I'm so happy he rolled his car. Assholes are destroying the natural environment with their bullshit cars
I just can't believe she had the nerve to call both [NAME] and [NAME] low ability
I think this does help less good pupils to learn it better and agree with the teachers. In my class thats the biggest problem when it comes to french
I love how the girl on her phone in the background sees what happened but just doesn’t care...must happen all the time.
Was this at Meadowvale? I wanted to take a pic but had my gloves on
Can't wait to die so I won't have to hear [NAME] breath in my ears 100 years from now.
Haha. Yeah there is a vaccination now. When I was a kid my parents did the same thing. It hadn’t been developed yet.
I love how she has no idea what to do. Like stop drop and roll 🤦‍♂️
I subbed to 2meirl4meirl back in 2016. It failed to pique my interest. Now every post feels like my life.
Yeah, I was thinking they would be super cute with black heels and a snug black crop top.
Too many injuries. I predict he will be off the roster by September.
Note to self: always remember to draw my eyebrows on before posting a selfie.
Oh wow this is good to know, it was always my go-to spicy ketchup when I make frozen fries at home.
No, I generally feel like slugging them in the head repeatedly with an iron bar. Spitting is just petty. *Let your hatred flow!*
This is the greatest thing I've read in my entire life
It's all good man, glad you shared it. Just felt I should defend my stance as well.
I'll think about prime, just heard a lot of negative about them that spooks me some.
I believe we are playing them in June and November in the Euro qualifiers
Always...really. married 31 years and she still turns me on!
Between this and the headline it makes me wonder how he fits his ego through most doorways.
I need the band name on his hoodie for, professional reasons!
I’m always reminded by my relatives on my birthday asking me if I have a girlfriend yet. Sorry bro ima yeet out of the social norm.
Thank you, I know my OHIP Is up to date as I have my health card in my wallet and I updated it myself when we moved
Fuck her. I hate her so much. I wish she’s just vanish back to Indonesia with her mustache.
That's the same thing 8 year olds use to try and get my items in video games. The guilt and shame strategy... Pathetic.
Especially if he looks good in your bra and panties ...can he give me his number?
My balls shrunk up looking at that
“I am so sorry! That was not my intention at all. My apologies” so charming. They do give you warning though
Ya? I don't really remember him much besides his crappy penalty shot attempt. What stuck out about him to you?
I'm sorry my Baby [NAME] joke made you so angry.
Then tell me what he's doing, instead of being a racist hypocrite.
Oh my goodness I was there yesterday! Luckily I didn't get bitten.
Headline had me thinking the guy was currently barricaded in a BK bathroom, demanding they give him free food. But no.
whats on his story? I dont have insta
I didn’t really need those 25 minutes of my life anyway
Teacher: "ok guys, put your phones down (and definitely don't send me the link)"
My case is like when you involuntarily subscribed to something while browsing a strange website and now can't unsubscribe.
Definitely my favorite reliever after Mo. loved his attitude and competitiveness.
Good luck my G
This and the Minneapolis miracle; I've never had so much pure uncontrolled emotion pour out of my body!
My heart is breaking for that little girl.
Wow, I know he is the voice of [NAME], but I did not know he basically IS [NAME]
I definitely get that vibe from this post. Or [NAME] was friends with them and didn’t get invited to the party lmao
Personally, I prefer my seafood not tainted by oil spills. But you do you!
I want to know them - so I can actually murder them. (With words, that is.)
I slept so great last night uwu More wins vs them please!
I have scars, but they’re not deliberately self-inflicted. I am just a massive klutz.
I really like [NAME]. He has such a great personality and has great chemistry with the team.
Roll Tide. In my house is [NAME], [NAME], and then everything else. Or something along those lines. /s
He’s a way worse version of [NAME]. I don’t think anyone is putting him in their top 15 besides Bears fans.
Time to do my thing.
