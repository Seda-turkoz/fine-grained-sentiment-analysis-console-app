Now we just need to kill [NAME] if [NAME] wasn't saved to really even the odds with her, similarly to [NAME] with [NAME].
Are you allowed to voice any political opinion on Youtube or are they also censoring based on this?

Dude just get them drunk.
They'd probably just use it to buy up armies and navies for tyrants who oppress and reign with blood and horror or some shit.
Not an effective solution. Shooter always has first move, taking out an unsuspecting teacher would give a shooter access to better arms.
And bigger than that. Her house, her rules.
Worse, he murdered King [NAME] in the most cowardly way possible. Both in the books and the show.
There are Cubs fans that died at 95 without ever having seen their favorite team win a title. At what point is the LOILTY worth it?

It's a great article. She nailed it.
He’s probably just getting stressed out that it is now getting dark and he lives in the countryside
[NAME] wore them today. Trying to be like her crush, [NAME]. It's kind of sweet.
Sucking [NAME] pecker! They're no respect for your dignity! Suck it!!!!

Well they never got into metal. Get over yourself and get a lot safer in the comments.

Stay strong friend.
Rude to NXT. They need to just let her go. She hasn’t improved in over a decade, she’s never going to
Of course he does lol. Not very often, but he definitely has to block from time to time.
They started seeling alcohol a while ago, when she called her mafia friend to get help for the speakeasy.
Because you’re harassing strangers over the internet about their happy healthy pet? Weirdo.

Damn, time to tweet Young House Love and find out what color they used on the brick...
People would still always parry them (600ms) :(
He needed to back off a little. He’s forcing it too much. Give her a second. You’re practically a stranger.
spurs getting carried away now. Fouling their own players.
He’s fine for a 3rd string.
Pretty and sweet? BURN HER ALIVE!! Nothing can detract from their beliefs!
It's simple, he's blunt, and that is what some people need.
If he were to come to the table with fewer red lines the EU might make different concessions.
Maybe try a flashlight next to her bed, so she can turn it on and look around if she gets scared?
Why would he get upset? Your husband was the one who went to PreCana classes and knows that using contraception is a means for annulment.
They were talking about what they should call the 'not Constantinople' release in the meeting- its a crime that nobody thought of this.

Good thing he realized this was pointless before he resigned from his state senate seat. ^/s
Nah just good drag henny. They paint for the back of the room.
Call your legislator and complain. Ill-mannered public servants tend to fear politicians more than they do lawyers.
He's not putting you first though, is he? It's his family first. That needs to be addressed.
The angle makes it look like he's 15 feet tall, but otherwise, very good.
If an addict gets clean of booze/drugs, you congratulate them! What a horrible crabbycrab to try to shut down someone who got their addiction under control.
And religion isn't displayed on uber page. She saw a brown person and refused to interact with them solely based on race. She's a racist.
He was also involved in a much less known NBC investigation into
They lost because they didn't run a leftist at all
But how's the breathing through the nose. That's the important question. Can he nail it?
Not everybody can grow their own or even wants to.
Oh no! More non-existent performance issues to complain about!! Can't wait to be playing it while all these self-righteous gamers take their noble stands...
[NAME] hoping he's [NAME] mum
His smile is so damn creepy
Also his Whirlpool seems to be bugged, sometime it stays for like 3more seconds even tho you don't get any damage from it anymore
Sadly, he seems immune to bans. He also dodges them with alts like [NAME]
Can he fire himself?
That's pretty good all things considered, if they want to maintain that, they really need to get a patch out ASAP
There was a deleted scene where she flirts with a woman. Which is waaaaay too much representation already!

For real! So happy they just put season 2 on hulu

Like that little pony who was trotting for his life, saying, “Oh shit oh shit oh shit!”
When they figure out a way to hoard the wealth created by marijuana it will be legalized.
Keep in mind with these verses you've selected you aren't mentioning how we must he crucified in the flesh with [NAME].
the upside is that they can hold quite a bit, so you can almost always just empty it in the comfort of your own bathroom
not just "got hurt" but nearly stabbed his eye out!!!
Interesting how [NAME] leads his team in BPM and RPM every year while not being the most important player. Defense and efficiency matters.
People don't have installation and maintenance costs and when they break down you can go outside and find another one really quick.
So if she tones down the intensity and controlling nature, would that change how you feel?
Yep. And if the reaction to the CovCath psyop is any indication there will be riots when her retirement or death is announced.
Thing is, some fans will *never* be happy. There is nothing that can be done to please them. That's the problem.
She took the fucking kids, huh?
Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix them up!
Mental games. Take a (mental) shot everytime the teacher mispronounces a word,or messes up grammatically
Honestly, this is hilarious. Did he reply?
Good luck trying to get out of the membership. They won’t make it easy.
He's probably already more than uncomfortable, just having a woman who isn't Mother that close to him.
It's a self-identifying group, and they have killed quite a bit of people in their crusade for revenge. It's both absolutely pathetic and absolutely terrifying.
He’s a douche because... why? He got turned on by some animal porn? Why does that make him a douche?
cant wait for their collective breakdown if she goes home
What the hell? Why can't people leave this place alone? They make good pizza. That's it. It's a pizza shop.
We all love our childbrain president and all the wonderful things he’s doing for ~~white~~ American people.
Mostly because they're not completely stupid. They don't have the support in the senate to pull it off.

Seems highly unethical for a lawyer to sign exclusive coverage contracts on their pending cases.
He was afraid of flying

Is there any attempt to use non-tainted symbol and to steer a non-hateful discourse in order to represent their pride?
His interviews are so awkward
he said the victims who survivied "pushed a fat person in front of the shooter" yeah that really 'making fun of bad ideas'
He's not THAT bad on YouTube, but on Twitter... Let's just say that he's problematic
allegedly it from when he was underage. So maybe let's not do that.
Shit he gets too close to a girl and she's liable to hit him with roach spray.
A person could easily say getting drunk on whiskey all day solves their problems.
[NAME] has personal experience with people turning into remorseless killers. What he thinks of walkers is immaterial.
And DICE has told us fuck all about how they intend to fix it and when to expect the fix.
Because they claim to be against [NAME], and they need something called "votes" to beat him?
Would it make you feel any better, little girl, if they was pushed out of windows?
Besides [NAME], [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME], he was the most skilled LoA member.

He thought that was a good idea...
This is from ralph lauren? [NAME], someone put their designer out of their misery.

#THEIR ONLY 3' ABOVE SEA LEVEL
Lmao that guy is awesome. You know he probably just found his new hobby.

He was cut yesterday, unfortunately

Good luck trying to get out of the membership. They won’t make it easy.
Just because some people troll him on Twitter and get literally no retweets or interactions, he'll surely change his way of directing...
It's interesting to watch what happens to people when they find out how easy it is to get on TV and get paid.
2 2nd rounders but not a first or a future first. He’s not worth the risk
Its like the other 3 teams are moving the [NAME] cube until it matches and they can be affective against the Patriots. Still not quite there

They have directly targeted civilians. It's disgusting.
lol why ? they were both garbage when their time was up
Reckon she'd have your back too OP!
Well sure his one appearance in relief lost us a game, but at least he didn’t get hurt.
He has become that which he swore to destroy!
Yeah he is crazy early game, but as soon as you get a few items on an ap character, you just kill him before he combos lol
Looks like you brought a nice variety for her to try, hope she enjoyed it!
He is but he's a normie. A 2/10 would be treated like a pariah at a dance class.

what happened to that uk transfer they picked up, haven't heard much about him
Interesting how [NAME] leads his team in BPM and RPM every year while not being the most important player. Defense and efficiency matters.

He aged twenty years with that look.
They don't care, even if that involves bringing any idiot in regardless what they tag along and other tenants have to suffer until or if they move.

[NAME] leans so far forward when he skates we love a king of physics and momentum 😤
They do, however this is a TRAFFIC unit that focus' on TRAFFIC offences. Ice dealers are more of a detective / taskforce job.
All these threads are being brigaded hard. They're not even trying to hide it.
He is warped by porn. He's got a problem
And if they can't find US suckers to give them cheap labor with desired skills, they'll simply replace you with an imported indentured laborer from India.

Living with her, he just might be!
Wonderful :D, she looks like [NAME] from Frozen, or [NAME] form Dota 2. Great job!

What was her emergency other than a teen throwing a temper tantrum
He is sacrificing himself for our sins. [NAME] bless.
[NAME] are as anti-men as democrats. Forcing your kids to be masculine because they're boys is as bad as brainwashing them with feminist crap.
She didn't believe that [NAME] left a Bomb. To [NAME] it could all be a trick to get her to come back.
Fat dad=fat kid
His character was created to be a love interest and it's literally the only thing they know how to use him for.
Shouldn’t really expect him to be doing well.. he’s a 3rd stringer playing 6man minutes
And the problem is that they took doctors out of a&e and out patients and community services and gp's to pay for his monstrosity...
Except for all those companies brushed off in the "and many more" category. Wasn't as lucrative for them.
She’s a good person who stands up for people not like her, and they can’t stand that.
That is disgusting. He should be embarrassed.
Your friend must have had a horrible time writing papers if adjectives like that were off limits
> 420 blaze it!! wasn't that the red sox payroll doe? they got their ring.....
Shock collars are horrible. They poor pup. 😫
What...? That’s some real mental gymnastics to justify him assaulting her
Canaryproject.org is great. They hold people accountable for saying horrible racist things.
Fun fact: [NAME] had the upper hand because he had a sling shot, ye olde wordy equivalent of a gun.
They're off thinking about ways they can avoid topics and deflect more, since they seem so good at that lately.
You know damn well they'd say "Narudo" and "Assault on Titan 13"
MAGA morons don't travel outside their state so they don't care about this.
Hang on to that feeling brother, it gets easier :)
her section at the tate museum is amazing
hahah if only he had reddit
And on her birthday! She is a rock star for sure tho. 🤓
All armed robbers, serial killers, rapists, swindlers all downplay the severity of their actions...
No it’s a lie because he could not possibly have been in Vietnam. And he did not correct a single outlet who said he was.
You his SO?
No they haven’t and that’s probably a lot of the problem
Hasn't he also lied about his height previously?
Well she mostly horrible when she was drunk, so drinking less for her would be a huge improvement.
She already is. The darling that WTA so badly needed with the talent to back
Well if they are in the playoffs it likely means we are not so that should be a cause for concern regardless of how they perform once they get there
No thanks, he’s already been flushed
No one is holding a gun to their heads telling them to moderate the sub, either.
You absolutely should not tell her.
Fuck that, he can go to Cleveland with [NAME] on that bullshit.
Yeah she really didn’t. It’s prob for the best even though it’s tough right now. Thank you
All the replies take his quote a little too seriously
Him being in prison (if these useless people and their story is real) HIV and Hep C should be a concern for her.
Huh. So it really comes down to looking at her senate career vs her AG career.
Everyone is allowed to have their own opinions, let's try to not resort to name calling no matter how much we disagree
You're right, but you forgot to mention they are registered [NAME]
She’s so hot. Also happy cake day
Oh shut up. Quit being dramatic. Another option is... THEY COULD HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT.
They live was a great film.
Except they fucking awarded it a prize first. It went through vetting, beat the other applicants, won, then was removed as not being correct?
“Facts don’t care about your feelings” is also a good one to chuck back at them.
But, oh boy, they can try.

Honestly nothing, death is an awful part of life. The only thing that can do anything is time. Just never forget them.
[NAME] first event was IW, not last year. So you're comparing his second year playing professionals on LAN vs Cells first time.
People will come for your body, stop putting that out there and you will see if they’re friends or not. See who stays for your personality
Lots of botox. That face doesn't move. She has to squint her eyes to indicate to others that she is mad.
The fact that big corporations that made their successes off capitalism are embracing Marxism is really disturbing.
This is getting out of hand! Now there’s two of them!
The sad thing is that most of them are gone the next election anyway.
Don't worry - there's only one barely known movie to his credit. Pretty easy to avoid.
Neat what she did. Tricked the trickster!
And then he calls the fans crybabies for saying his movie sucked. Just take the L dude.
Agreed. Sometimes you just have to move forward and let those determined to be left behind have their wish.
Israel is only demonized because they DEFEND themselves from their neighbors who OPENLY admit they are dedicated to the destruction of Israel and the [RELIGION] people.
She has no idea.
[NAME] looked like he was having a heart attack the entire game... welcome to the madhouse lol
He’s such a thumb!!!
Those are still huge numbers for a guy that can’t even take a free throw without double clutching his shot.
Most of the people on top aren't even very relevant anymore, at least not nearly as relevant as they used to be
It seems to be his Twitter reactions really. He prob needs to spend less time there
You don't get it, they mean *these* types of immigrants, not *those* types of immigrants
They didn’t even ask about her in the phone call. Does that not seem just a tiny bit odd to you? HONEST ANSWER PLEASE
They bothered to attack darling in the franxx
She may want you and your boyfriend out, so her daughter can take the bedroom. A family meeting might force her to be honest.
The entire culture of NE is win at all costs. Not sure where you live but if that kid shovels snow..tell mom to him bring home .
The Colts badly wanted to hire him. He’d get a GM job in a heartbeat if he wanted it.
He looks like he’s trying to blow shit up with his mind
Yes... you little crybabies call them fascist too? People who kill fascists are fascists right?
His truck was never used by ISIS.
Looks like emotionally and physically beating the shit out of his wife and children was not wasted then.
Honestly Quadriga has been pretty decent, can't fault them for the bank struggle, that's just how the Canadian banks have been towards this space.
He is [NAME]. That's the twist this soap opera needs!
Her absence is probably the greatest present she can give you. Enjoy it while you can.
It's probably easier when they're stuck on an island
Police numbers in London are at their lowest (per head of population) in twenty years. Those fucking cuts!
If he signs with the Padres: Love If he doesn’t sign with the Padres: Indifferent
You should have started to tickle his feet
[NAME] hasn't been found guilty, YET, but he has killed before and bribes every official he sees
This is reddit, unfortunately it's entirely possible he isn't being sarcastic
They never will until it affects them directly, and by then it's already in the end game for us :/
In addition to poor judgement, she is incapable of admitting she is wrong and apologizing.
If New Jersey are going to win it in the winter they better get something done quickly..
It’s more like a large youtuber trying to sue a smaller youtuber because both of their names have a C in it.
Can’t believe they actually got married. What a joke
BONE-SHAKINGLY MEDIOCRE BROTHER
He's not debating he's asking the questions to the debaters and said he wants to purposely ruin in of their arguments
[NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] looks like... He ain't natty
You met her in Tinder.... enough said bro....
Crash. We should stop calling them "accidents" because they rarely are. Crash implies, as it should, blame.
Next time just tell her she paid for a Venti so that’s what she is getting😂
[NAME] and [NAME] have said peach is by far bowser’s worst MU in the past. They discuss it in this thread:
Curious as to why he's been passed up so many times now.
They need all the help they can get. If they continue their bad form they can get relegated. They just fired [NAME]
oh cool! Must be tiring for [NAME] though. Looking forward to watching them!
The ruling class doesn't care. Their only goal is to plunder and loot the country for their own financial gain.

He looks like [NAME] in Jackass 2 when they glued pubes to his face.
Luckily for her former therapist maybe she can no longer leave her home.
That, and truthers. Like, why? It just makes everything else she says seem suspect to the average person regardless of how sound it is.
Justifying a potential rape because "it's [NAME] and she should feel thankful," Wow.
